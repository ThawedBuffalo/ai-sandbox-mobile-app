# Figma Build Checklist: Dental Procedure Cost Estimator

## Automated Setup - Figma MCP (Preferred)

This checklist is MCP-first and does not require a Figma plugin.
Use the configured MCP server in `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
"figma": {
  "url": "https://mcp.figma.com/mcp",
  "type": "http"
}
```

### Preconditions

1. Confirm `.vscode/mcp.json` includes the `figma` server.
2. Confirm `project-config.json` includes:
   - `figma.fileUrl`
   - `figma.fileKey`
3. Ensure you are authenticated to Figma in your MCP-capable client.

### MCP Build Steps

1. Open the target file:
   - https://www.figma.com/design/Mpbx4Oqsr9kMPqBGeas76y/Untitled
2. Use your MCP-capable client to connect to the `figma` MCP server.
3. Create pages in this order:
   - `01 Flow Map`
   - `02 Wireframes Desktop`
   - `03 Wireframes Mobile`
   - `04 Components and States`
   - `05 Handoff Notes`
4. Create frames/components from this checklist using exact names.
5. Add annotations for requirement traceability and accessibility notes.

### Expected Build Scope

| Page | Frames |
|------|--------|
| 01 Flow Map | UX-F1, UX-F2, UX-F3, UX-F4 |
| 02 Wireframes Desktop | EST-01 through EST-06 |
| 03 Wireframes Mobile | EST-07 through EST-10 |
| 04 Components and States | C-01 through C-14 |
| 05 Handoff Notes | HO-01 |

3. Add a top-level section on each page named Dental Procedure Cost Estimator.
4. Use frame names exactly as defined below for traceability.

## Page 01: Flow Map
1. Create frame UX-F1 Supported Procedure Estimate.
   - Show entry: estimator page load.
   - Show actions: select procedure, select tier, estimate.
   - Show outcomes: loading, success, validation error, retrieval error.
2. Create frame UX-F2 Tier Comparison.
   - Show entry: existing result.
   - Show action: change tier.
   - Show outcomes: recalculation loading, updated result, recalculation error.
3. Create frame UX-F3 Unsupported Procedure Recovery.
   - Show entry: unsupported procedure submitted.
   - Show outcomes: unsupported message, return to supported list.
4. Create frame UX-F4 Error and Retry.
   - Show entry: failed estimate or recalculation.
   - Show outcomes: user-safe error, retry loading, retry success.
5. Add connector labels for empty, loading, success, error, unsupported states.

## Page 02: Wireframes Desktop
1. Create frame EST-01 Home Empty (Desktop).
   - Include page title.
   - Include helper text describing estimate purpose.
   - Include empty procedure selector.
   - Include three-option tier selector.
   - Include disabled Estimate cost button.
2. Create frame EST-02 Home Ready (Desktop).
   - Show selected procedure.
   - Show selected tier.
   - Show active Estimate cost button.
3. Create frame EST-03 Result Success (Desktop).
   - Show result heading.
   - Show estimated member responsibility as primary value.
   - Show plan-paid amount as secondary value.
   - Show visible disclaimer block.
4. Create frame EST-04 Result Error (Desktop).
   - Show result region with user-safe error message.
   - Show Retry action.
   - Preserve previously selected procedure and tier.
5. Create frame EST-05 Unsupported Procedure (Desktop).
   - Show unsupported procedure message.
   - Show CTA to return to supported list.
6. Create frame EST-06 Result Loading (Desktop).
   - Show loading state in result region.
   - Use skeleton or neutral placeholders.
   - Keep input selections visible.

## Page 03: Wireframes Mobile
1. Create frame EST-07 Home Ready (Mobile).
   - Stack procedure selector, tier selector, and button vertically.
   - Keep tap target sizes accessible.
2. Create frame EST-08 Result Success (Mobile).
   - Keep member responsibility as first visible value.
   - Keep plan-paid amount directly below.
   - Keep disclaimer visible without hidden interaction.
3. Create frame EST-09 Result Error (Mobile).
   - Show concise error banner and Retry action.
4. Create frame EST-10 Unsupported Procedure (Mobile).

## Page 04: Components and States
1. Create component Procedure Selector / Default.
2. Create component Procedure Selector / Validation Error.
3. Create component Procedure Selector / Load Error.
4. Create component Tier Selector / 3 Option.
5. Create component Button / Primary / Default.
6. Create component Button / Primary / Disabled.
7. Create component Button / Primary / Loading.
8. Create component Result Card / Success.
9. Create component Result Card / Loading.
10. Create component Result Card / Error.
11. Create component Alert / Unsupported Procedure.
12. Create component Disclaimer / Estimate.
13. Create component Breakdown Row / Member Responsibility.
14. Create component Breakdown Row / Plan Paid.

## Component Rules
1. Procedure selector must support searchable/selectable common procedures.
2. Tier selector must represent preventive, basic restorative, major restorative.
3. Estimate button stays disabled until both required inputs are selected.
4. Disclaimer component must use exact copy:
   - This is an estimate only and not a guarantee of benefits or payment.
5. Error component must use user-safe language only.

## Page 05: Handoff Notes
1. Add section Requirement Mapping.
   - FR1 maps to procedure selector.
   - FR2 maps to estimate action and result states.
   - FR3 maps to breakdown rows.
   - FR4 maps to disclaimer component.
   - FR5 maps to tier selector recalculation behavior.
   - FR6 maps to immediate loading feedback.
   - FR7 maps to no PII inputs or labels.
   - FR8 maps to synthetic-data-only assumptions.
2. Add section Accessibility.
   - Keyboard order: Procedure -> Tier -> Estimate -> Result -> Disclaimer.
   - Result updates announced via polite live region.
   - Error summaries use alert semantics.
   - Do not use color alone to communicate state.
3. Add section Behavior Notes.
   - Latest request wins during rapid tier switching.
   - Retry preserves current selections.
   - Unsupported procedures show guided recovery, not generic error.
4. Add section Open Decisions.
   - Final supported procedure list.
   - Final legal approval of disclaimer text.
   - Default tier on first load.

## Visual Direction Guidance
1. Keep the UI calm and trust-building, not clinical or overly technical.
2. Use a clean responsive layout with strong hierarchy around the member amount.
3. Make disclaimer visible but visually secondary to the result.
4. Use distinct empty, loading, success, error, and unsupported states.
5. Keep desktop and mobile visually consistent.

## Accessibility Checklist
1. Verify all interactive controls have visible focus styles.
2. Verify text and controls meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast.
3. Verify mobile tap targets are large enough.
4. Verify screen-reader labels exist for selectors and buttons.
5. Verify error and result updates have appropriate announcement behavior.

## Final Review Before Handoff
1. Confirm every frame maps to a documented flow or requirement.
2. Confirm disclaimer appears on every success result frame.
3. Confirm no PII fields or identity cues appear anywhere in the design.
4. Confirm unsupported and error states are included on both desktop and mobile.
5. Confirm naming consistency with the UX artifacts.
